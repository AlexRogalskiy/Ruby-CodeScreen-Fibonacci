# Ruby-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen Ruby assessment that requires the candidate to return the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The class to write this method in is `lib/fibonacci.rb`.

The tests that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in `test/test_fibonacci.rb`.

The tests that are run and are not visible to the candidate are located in `test/test_hidden_fibonacci.rb`.
